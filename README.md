# Welcome to my Personal Site!

This is my personal website where I write articles about software development and my personal interests. As a front-end developer, I built this site using Gatsby and MDX, which allows me to write content in markdown format while still being able to use React components.

## Getting Started

To view the site locally, first, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with the following command:

```
npm run development
```

This will start the Gatsby development server and you can view the site at `http://localhost:8000/`.

To build the site for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

## Contributing

If you find any issues or want to contribute to the site, please feel free to create a pull request. Any feedback is welcome and appreciated.
