Consistency is crucial for creating a positive perception of a product, brand, or company. At CyVerse, we faced issues with consistency and sought to improve our approach. After evaluating the causes and solutions, we implemented a standard component library, design system, and style guide to create a single source of truth, called CyVerse-UI.

## The Negative Effects of Inconsistency

Inconsistency in color, typography, user experience, branding, and other areas can be the most damaging issue for an application. As humans, we naturally seek order and predictability, recognizing rules to conserve mental energy. Breaking our own rules can pull the rug out from under users and cause confusion, frustration, and anxiety. This leads to a lack of user confidence, a perception of poor quality, and an undependable product.

## Factors Contributing to Inconsistency

Not enough reuse of code leads to maintenance problems and visual inconsistency as changes are made to views. Without a formalized design system, even with good intentions, inconsistencies will occur. With different teams working on their own products, products suffer from inconsistency, and a lack of consistency between products is possible.

## Solutions to Inconsistency

A component library is a collection of reusable components that allows us to have a single source of truth for a UI element or pattern, which gives us better maintainability and can enforce design consistency. A pattern library keeps things more consistent by breaking features into smaller reusable patterns. A centralized library applied to the organization as a whole creates a consistent ecosystem, where the user can move from feature to feature and product to product comfortably.

## CyVerse-UI

CyVerse-UI is our company's answer to these problems. It is a standardized set of reusable components available to all of the CyVerse ecosystem. It creates a design system that brings consistency to the look and feel, the CyVerse brand, and the user experience. It is also a design system that can be used to design new features with a consistent approach.
