As a fan of CSS in JS, I have successfully transitioned two separate companies with large code bases to adopt this approach. The first time I pitched this idea was during the early days of React, when CSS in JS was still considered a radical idea proposed by some developers at Facebook. Implementing CSS in JS required a thorough evaluation and consideration of the potential challenges and questions. I delivered a presentation to both companies outlining the common issues with traditional CSS and how CSS in JS addresses them, while also addressing any concerns or questions that were raised at the time. In this post I wanted to list some of the more valid concerns I've heard.


## Increased complexity

CSS in JS requires learning new tools and systems, which can increase the complexity of your codebase. This can make it harder to onboard new developers.

### Thoughts

While CSS in JS may require learning new tools and techniques, it makes your codebase more modular, improves code encapsulation, and is easier to maintain over time. This also makes it easier to understand as there are fewer factors affecting why a particular element is styled the way it is. JS has better tooling for linting and throws errors. CSS bugs due to syntax can be very difficult to track down. CSS in JS also removes the need for learning and enforcing naming conventions and selector rules. It is easier and more direct to include programmatic or dynamic CSS rules with JS, whereas CSS often has tricks or hacks that are less easy to understand and maintain by others.

To illustrate this, let me provide an anecdote. At my current role, we have a lot of applications still using freemarker and jQuery. We decided that rather than convert these to React at this time, we would rewrite the CSS. For the modular benefits and documentation we chose to use SUITCSS (a flavor of BEM) as our naming convention. We made components from our component library, pattern examples, linting rules, wrote documentation, and trained our team. We found that even between us, the architects, there was still debate and confusion. Code reviews with the rest of the team exposed more of the same. Even though we had a style guide and linting rules, we still had a lot of confusion and inconsistency. In comparison, our code reviews for styling React components with CSS in JS were much more straightforward, and we had a lot less confusion and inconsistency or disagreements. We still struggled with naming things, but that was less critical as components are not global like CSS is.

## Tooling

There are many different libraries and tools available for CSS in JS, which can make it difficult to choose the right one for your project. Additionally, some tools may not integrate well with your existing toolchain.

## Thoughts
I can't argue that CSS in JS will integrate well with your existing toolchain. It is a different approach and requires different tools. And is not right for every project.

As far as the breadth of options, there are many libraries tools and conventions to choose for your project with CSS. I would argue that CSS in JS is more simple in this regard and has fewer options and that this is one of it's selling points. 

## Accessibility

Some developers are concerned that using CSS in JS may make it harder to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.

### Thoughts
This one I actually don't think is valid but I have heard it enough times I wanted to add it anyway.

Accessability is achieved by writing accessible code, such as providing alternative text for images and using semantic HTML and aria labels. There are ways to hide content from visual users yet visible to screen readers with CSS and ways to hide it from screen readers through aria roles and attributes yet visible to visual users. I don't see how CSS in JS would make this any more difficult.

## Learning curve

CSS in JS is a relatively new approach, and some developers may not be familiar with the tools and techniques required to implement it effectively. Moreover, many CSS wizards are not comfortable writing JS.

### Thoughts

While there may be a learning curve associated with using CSS in JS, this can also be seen as an opportunity to learn new skills and techniques that can make you a more versatile and valuable developer in the long run.

I would also say that this is related to the first concern around tooling and complexity. I would argue that CSS in JS is less complex and easier to learn in terms of not having to learn naming conventions, selector rules, and other CSS hacks and tricks.

Regarding individuals who feel more comfortable with CSS than with JS, I cannot speak for everyone, but I have observed that those who have a CSS-heavy background are often eager to broaden their JS knowledge. React's similarities to HTML and CSS create an excellent opportunity for them to expand their skills while remaining productive and valuable to the team by applying their existing skills. They also tend to grasp the issues that CSS in JS solves well and are generally enthusiastic about its potential.

## Code Separation

One of the primary concerns raised by developers regarding CSS-in-JS is code separation. Some developers prefer to keep their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code separated, and may view CSS-in-JS as an anti-pattern.

### Thoughts

Using CSS-in-JS is a different pattern that can provide benefits in terms of code encapsulation and modularity. Additionally, many CSS-in-JS libraries provide features that make it easy to separate your styles from your JavaScript code.

In reality, if you're writing maintainable CSS, you're probably already separating your CSS into modules and components through conventions like BEM and collocating your CSS with your components. This is a 1:1 relationship between markup and styles. CSS-in-JS is embracing this and enforcing it explicitly rather than implicitly, which is a good thing.

## Performance

Another issue raised by developers is that CSS-in-JS is less performant than regular CSS.

### Thoughts

This is a valid concern, and it's true that some libraries may not be as performant as regular CSS. However, there are ways to mitigate the performance hit, such as using server-side rendering or using a library that supports CSS extraction.

It's worth noting that the performance hit may not be significant enough to outweigh the benefits of using CSS-in-JS for many projects. Additionally, as browsers and libraries work out standard APIs to handle CSS outside the render cycles, CSS-in-JS performance will only improve with time.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, CSS-in-JS is a pattern that offers some benefits but also has some potential drawbacks. Understanding the concerns around CSS-in-JS can help you make an informed decision on whether or not to use it in your projects.

Ultimately, the decision to use CSS-in-JS depends on the requirements of your project and the tradeoffs you're willing to make. By keeping these concerns in mind, you can make an informed decision that is best for your specific use case.
