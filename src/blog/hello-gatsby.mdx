This is my first post. I decided to build a static site for my blog. I'm trying out Gatsby and so far I like it. Gatsby is a framework and static site generator built in node. It uses React for the view layer and graphql for the data layer.

Rather than go into detail about Gatsby or React, as I will hopefully talk more about those in detail, I wanted to say "hello world" and briefly cover what a static site is, some benifits they offer, and why we might use one.

In the world of web development, there are many different approaches to building a website or web application. One approach that has been gaining popularity in recent years is the use of static sites.

## What is a Static Site?

At its most basic level, a static site is a collection of files that are served directly to the user's browser. There is no dynamic content or server-side processing involved. This means that everything the user sees is pre-built and stored in files on a server. When the user requests a page, the server simply sends the appropriate file back to the browser.

## Why Use a Static Site?

There are several reasons why a static site might be the perfect fit for your next project:

### Speed

Because there is no server-side processing involved, static sites are incredibly fast. They require minimal processing power and can be served from a basic file server. This means that your pages will load quickly and your users won't have to wait for server-side code to execute.

### Scalability and Cost

Static sites are incredibly scalable. Because they don't require much processing power, they can be distributed across multiple servers to handle high traffic loads. This makes them a cost-effective solution for sites that need to scale quickly or handle large volumes of traffic.

### Micro Services

Even if your site needs some dynamic content, you can use micro services to handle those requests. For example, you might use a separate service for user authentication, a shopping cart, or payment processing. This allows you to keep your static site lightweight while still providing the functionality your users need.

### An Alternate Web Model

Static sites can be distributed and shared over peer-to-peer networks, which offers an alternative to the current HTTP-based web model. Beaker Browser is an experimental browser that enables a distributed web, where there is no central server. Websites are shared across peers, which can eliminate the complexity of scaling and reward popularity rather than punishing it. This is because the more popular a site is, the more peers it will have to share the load.

## Conclusion

Static sites offer many benefits, including speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. They can be a great choice for projects that don't require complex server-side processing or dynamic content.
