          # Hello and Welcome 
          Hi there, I'm Tharon, a software engineer with a passion for frontend development. My expertise lies in design systems, theming, and component libraries, and I'm no stranger to collaborating with designers to create seamless user experiences.

          My go-to framework for building the view layer is React, but I'm also exploring the potential of Elm, ReasonML, and native web components. I'm a big advocate for CSS in JS, but I only recommend it if it aligns with your coding preferences or if the project has a large enough code base where the nature of CSS becomes problematic.

          I don't believe in being dogmatic about anything, and I recognize that every situation has its own set of trade-offs. That's why I take a pragmatic approach and tailor my solutions to fit each unique situation.

          When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my wife and two kids. You might also find me playing music or tinkering with physical computing projects, often all at once. Overall, I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
