          # Hello and Welcome 
          Hi there, I'm Tharon, a software engineer with a passion for frontend development. My expertise lies in design systems, theming, and component libraries, I enjoy the creative side of building software and collaborating with designers to solve problems and create seamless user experiences.

          My go-to framework for building the view layer is still React, but I'm also exploring other tools like Elm, ReasonML, and native web components. I'm a big advocate for CSS in JS, but I only recommend it if it aligns with your coding preferences or if the project has a large enough code base where the nature of CSS becomes problematic.

          I also like to build tools and CLI libraries in Node, Rust or Typescript. I have experience with GraphQL, REST, and serverless architecture. I'm a big fan of the JAMstack and have built several sites using Gatsby. I'm also a big fan of TypeScript and have been using it for years.

          I don't believe in being dogmatic about any approach or tool, and I recognize that every situation has its own set of trade-offs. That's why I take a pragmatic approach and tailor my solutions to best fit each unique situation.

          When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my wife and two kids. You might also find me playing music, tinkering with physical computing projects, hiking, or working on our homestead. Overall, I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in this ever-evolving space.
